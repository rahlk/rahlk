### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I am Rahul.

I work in the intersection of Machine Learning and Programming Languages for modernizing legacy applications and mainitaining cloud-native applications. Prior to this, I was Post doctoral fellow at Columbia University working [ARiSE Lab](https://www.rayb.info/ariselab) with Dr. Baishakhi Ray (see [rayb.info](rayb.info)) where my research explored the ways in which Machine Learning can be used to *trigger, detect, and repair* various problem across the software lifecycle.

I obtained my PhD form [RAISE Lab](http://ai4se.net/) at NC State University under the guidance of Dr. Tim Menzies (see [menzies.us](http://menzies.us)). During my PhD, I worked on *actionable analytics* for software engineering. I developed algorithms that go beyond prediction to generate insights that can assist decision making. I also worked on developing data mining techniques (transfer learning) to generate insights even when sufficient data is not available. For more details, see:
